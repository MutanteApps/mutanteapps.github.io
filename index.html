    <p>
      These are some projects I worked on,
      most of them are in python, some are webpages.
      My main focus is Evolutive Algorithm, then AI, then Games (XD).

    <h4 class="section-head">Web Apps</h4>
    <a href="https://mutanteapps.github.io/colorselector/">Color selector</a>

      be to be safe.

  <a>Chaos iterator</a>
    <p>
      An python package to run and save values in a chaotic system.
      There are some equations saved, b
